# PythonPractice
I am about to start my Python learning journey. Hope this continues untill I do atleast 5 Python projects.

## Git Commands

To clone a repository(not needed in codespaces, needed for local development):

    git clone URL

To list the local branches:

    git branch

To create a branch:

    git checkout -b class01

To see the latest local changes:

To exactly see the changes made on a single file:

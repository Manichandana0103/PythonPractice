# PythonPractice
I am about to start my Python learning journey. Hope this continues untill I do atleast 5 Python projects.

## Git Commands

To clone a repository(not needed in codespaces, needed for local development):

    git clone URL

To list the local branches:

    git branch

To create a branch:

    git checkout -b class01

To see the latest local changes:

    git status

To check/verify see the changes made on a single file:

    git diff filename

To stage the changes:

    git add filename

To commit the changes:

    git commit -m "commit message"

To push the change:

    git push origin <SourceBranch>

        class -> main
        ex: get push origin class01

### Daily

To check the branch is clean

    git status

To checkout to the main branch

    git checkout main

To get the latest changes

    git pull origin main

To create new branch

    git checkout -b <newbranchname>
